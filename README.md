# Streamdeck Application

This is an application for the Elgato Stream Deck which functionalities should be comparable to the officially provided Software of Elgato. The key difference is: this software is working under Linux and is fully open-source! Furthermore the GUI is provided via a one-page website which means the stream deck is configurable from other devices in the same network which the stream deck is not directly connected to via USB.

## Installation

TODO

## Usage

After everything is installed the software offers several features such as:

- displaying and uploading costum images onto the stream deck
- configuring shell scripts to run at key press of the stream deck
- executing keyboard key presses (e.g. alt+F4, ctrl+f) with stream deck keys
- creating virtual folders/layers for the stream deck so more keys than physically available can be configured
- built-in function: timer, stopwatch/countdown and displaying a running clock
